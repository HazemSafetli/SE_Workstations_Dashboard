# SE_Workstations_Dashboard
A lightweight monitoring dashboard for three Ubuntu workstations. A Python stats agent runs on each machine and exposes a REST API. The single-page dashboard fetches live data from all agents and displays CPU, RAM, Disk, CPU Temperature, GPU, users, processes, and a 7-day history chart per machine.
